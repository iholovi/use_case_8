# Getting Started with Simple Form Application
## Description
This is a simple form application that consists of two main components:
- Form - a three-field form that allows user to enter their first name, last name and email. Each field is validated by a complex algorithm that ensures the highest data reliability.
- Store state - this component represents the submitted form data (once it passed the validation) and allows us to observe the data flow in the application.
## Installation
This application requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18+ and NPM to run.
1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/iholovi/use_case_8 && cd use_case_8
